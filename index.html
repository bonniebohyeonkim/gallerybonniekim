          <br><br>

          The sculpture represents a gravestone which is where the ritual takes place. This is further connected to the process of building this piece as the entire sculpture is made of collectively found materials. Objects which were deemed useless were now being used to create something meaningful, which reminds me of how we celebrate our ancestors who are no longer here with us on the event of the Day of the Dead</p>

        <p>Installation, 125 x 119 x 167 cm
          <br><br>
          OHP films, flour dough, yeast, string light bulbs
          <br><br>
          Melting on Melting is composed of 350 sheets of OHP films with printed images, flour dough with yeast, and light bulb installation. The image on each OHP film contains products and objects with features of melting: candle, ice cream, chocolate, and cheese. While the object itself stays still at the moment it was taken as a photo, the printed images of them change as it melts by a heat gun. The entire sculpture has a melting-like form from the top. The images on the top area are less heated up and less transformed while the images are more destroyed as it goes to the bottom. The fermented flour dough is placed on the surface of the work. </p>

          When You Cannot Do What You Are Supposed to Do reflects my experience in my bed while preparing to get to sleep. This work refers to the contrast between myself being interrupted by small light and sound and my bedroom which is silent and dark. The sculpture in the middle of the space is made of silicon and luminous pigments which glow more, especially in the dark. The speaker that is covered with the silicon contains noises that irritate me in the bed: clock ticking sound, air purifier, heating pad, toilet flushing, elevator sound, and refrigerator motor noise. The two projections with different sizes from the beam projectors display the one space from different angles simultaneously.

        <h3>How Fresh Can Be Fresh</h3>
        <a href="3fresh.html">Detail View</a>
        <p>
          Installation, 32.5 x 23 x 8 cm (10ea)

          Plastic packages, printed images on canvas fabric, labels
          <br><br>
          Plastic packages, which contain the images of fresh food printed on the canvas fabric, are displayed on the wall. How Fresh Can Be Fresh stands for everything people eat is already dead and deals with the question: why are the dead things called FRESH? At the moment the organism dies, it starts being rotten and people consume it during the rotting process. The printed images on the canvas fabric contain the moment of new organisms growing from the one used to be alive and the conceptually dead organisms that are advertised as FRESH products in markets. It highlights that the word FRESH does not represent FRESH and it has lost its meaning. Since FRESH itself is a value that is rapidly lost, by printing images on the canvas fabric which are used to preserve painting for a long time and it is a completely different feature from FRESH, the materials point out the conceptual aspect. Moreover, as the images are packed inside of the plastic packages that are commonly used in markets to sell FRESH foods, it refers to the products that are advertised as FRESH and satirize the meaning of FRESH
